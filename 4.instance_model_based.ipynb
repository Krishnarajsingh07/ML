    "## __✅ 1. Instance-Based Learning (Lazy Learning)__\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-based learning stores the training data and makes predictions by comparing new samples to stored examples.\n",
    "It does not create an explicit model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 It is called lazy learning because it delays the generalization process until prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__🔍 How it works__\n",
    "\n",
    "All training instances are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new query comes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm compares the query to stored instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses similarity/distance metrics (like Euclidean distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicts the output based on the most similar instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "__📌 Key Features__\n",
    "\n",
    "No explicit model built during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is fast (no learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction is slow (needs to search through training data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Performs local generalization (only for nearby instances).\n",
    "\n",
    "__⭐ Advantages__\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple to understand and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapts well to complex decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works well with large training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for non-linear problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "__❌ Disadvantages__\n",
    "\n",
    "Slow prediction (high latency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires lots of memory.\n",
