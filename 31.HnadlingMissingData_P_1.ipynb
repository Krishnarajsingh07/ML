    "\n",
    "For **Complete Case Analysis (CCA)** to give valid and unbiased results, the following assumptions must hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)\n",
    "The most important assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of missingness is **independent of both observed and unobserved data**\n",
    "- Missing values occur **purely by chance**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example:\n",
    "- Data missing due to accidental data entry error\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Violation:\n",
    "- High-income people not reporting salary\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Removed Rows Are Representative\n",
    "- The rows that are dropped should be **similar to the rows that remain**\n",
    "- No systematic difference between deleted and retained observations\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is violated → **selection bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3. Sufficient Remaining Sample Size\n",
    "- After removing incomplete rows, enough data must remain\n",
    "- Otherwise:\n",
    "  - Statistical power decreases\n",
    "  - Model performance degrades\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 4. Missing Data Proportion Is Small\n",
    "- CCA is safe when missing data is **very low** (typically < 5%)\n",
    "- Large missing percentages → heavy data loss\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 5. No Informative Missingness\n",
    "- Missingness itself should **not carry information**\n",
    "- If missing values indicate something meaningful, CCA is inappropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Missing medical test results because patients are too sick\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
